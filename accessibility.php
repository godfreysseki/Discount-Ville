						<h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
						<h3>Effective Date: September 27, 2023</h3>
						<p>At Discount-ville, we are dedicated to creating an inclusive online marketplace that is accessible to individuals and businesses of all sizes. Our primary objective is to ensure that anyone, without a business, can create a simple
							account and
							begin selling items online. We also aim to provide dedicated "rooms" on our site for business owners and their customers, facilitating smoother interactions. Additionally, we are committed to helping small businesses gain visibility and
							avoid overstocking through features that allow them to check item availability in other shops.</p>
						
						<h3>Our Commitment to Accessibility</h3>
						<p><b>1. Simplicity and Ease of Use: </b>We prioritize simplicity and user-friendliness, making it easy for anyone to register and start selling or shopping on Discount-ville.</p>
						<p><b>2. Dedicated Business "Rooms": </b>We offer dedicated virtual spaces for businesses, creating a more personalized and efficient experience for both business owners and their customers.</p>
						<p><b>3. Small Business Support: </b>We are committed to supporting small businesses by providing tools and features that enhance their visibility and help them manage their inventory effectively.</p>
						<p><b>4. Accessibility for All: </b>We strive to ensure that our platform is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities or assistive technologies.
							Feedback and Support</p>
						<p>If you encounter any accessibility barriers on our platform or have suggestions for improvement, please contact us at <?= email(COMPANYEMAIL) ?>. We value your input and are dedicated to continually enhancing the accessibility of
